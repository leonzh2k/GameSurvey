## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript


## Features
* Responsive Design (try it on different devices!)
* Form Validation 
* Dropdown Menu
* Saves Form Input On page reload/close/switch
* Options to clear form data and all stored data
* Navigation feature for those who just want to explore the site

### To-do
* Use a server-side language (possibly PHP) to send results of survey to an email address

## Things to Keep In Mind
* This website has no back-end functionality; as a consequence form input is not actually sent anywhere. This may be changed in a future release
* The "Navigation" section of the Settings menu allows you to bypass form validation and thus detracts from the intended user experience. This option has been provided for users who just want to take a look around without having to fulfill all form requirements first. If you want the intended user experience, it is recommended to not use this.
